### **Slide 4: Why NGP?**  
- **How to present:**  
  - "Why did we build NGP? Traditional marketing approaches lacked personalization and scalability."  
  - "With the rise of data-driven decision-making, we needed a robust system that could dynamically select offers based on customer behavior."  
  - "NGP ensures we stay ahead in digital marketing  and drive customer engagement more effectively."

---

### **Slide 5: Introduction**  
- **How to present:**  
  - "NGP is a highly scalable PySpark-based application, managed via Airflow, which automates the process of delivering personalized offers."  
  - "This platform processes large amounts of data, extracts insights, trains models, and efficiently delivers offers through email."

---

### **Slide 6: Phases of NGP**  
- **How to present:**  
  - "NGP operates in three major phases: Feature Phase, Model Training Phase, and Monarch Workflow Phase."  
  - "Each phase plays a crucial role in ensuring that our customers receive the best possible offers."

---

### **Slide 7: Feature Phase**  
- **How to present:** 

**“In the **Feature Phase** of our Next Gen Platform, we focus on extracting and preparing data for model training. Here's how it works:**

1. **Data Extraction & Storage:**  
   - First, we **extract data** from **EDAP** and other relevant sources. This data is then **stored in Delta tables**, which allow for fast querying and efficient access. Delta tables help maintain the data in a structured, accessible format.

2. **Active Pipelines:**  
   - There are **10 active pipelines** running during this phase. For example, pipelines like **monarch_cf_ngp.ccp seg** and **ngp financial** focus on specific feature extraction tasks. These pipelines ensure that the data is processed and ready for model training.

3. **Data Quality Assurance:**  
   - We ensure data integrity by using **sensors** that monitor data availability and completion. This is important for maintaining **high-quality data** throughout the extraction process. We also use **anomaly detection** to identify any outliers or issues early.

4. **Issue Alerts:**  
   - If there are any issues with the data extraction, we have **email notifications** set up to alert the team immediately. This ensures quick responses and troubleshooting to keep the process smooth.

**In short, this phase ensures that we have reliable, structured, and clean features ready for the next steps in the process.”**

This explanation is concise but informative, keeping the focus on key points while ensuring clarity for your audience. It also has a logical flow, making it easy to follow!
  - **Pro tip:** If asked about **Delta tables**, explain that they are a storage format optimized for big data analytics.

### **Slide 8: Model Training Phase**  
- **How to present:**  
  - "Once we have the data, we move into the Model Training Phase. This is where we build models to assign offers intelligently."  
  - "There are three main types of models:  
    - **Uplift Model**: Assigns offers based on predicted customer response.  
    - **Random Model**: Uses predefined configurations to assign offers randomly.  
    - **Picker Model**: Selects the best products for offer recommendations."  
  - "We also use **MLFlow** for model tracking and versioning."
Introduction
Start by introducing the slide with a brief overview:

"In this phase of the Next Gen Platform, we focus on training machine learning models that assign personalized offers to Starbucks customers. Let me take you through the details of the model training process."
Objective
"The primary goal of this phase is to train machine learning models that can assign relevant offers to customers based on their behavior and preferences."
This is the foundational objective, setting the stage for the audience.

Types of Offers
"We create two main types of offers for the customers."
Product-Based Offers: These are tailored based on product recommendations (e.g., a customer gets an offer on a product they are likely to purchase).
Frequency-Based Offers: These offers depend on how frequently a customer interacts with Starbucks (e.g., offers for customers who visit regularly).
&_________________&&&&&&&_________
Types of Models
"The platform employs three types of models for offer assignment."
Uplift Model: This model determines the best offers based on customer behavior and the expected effectiveness of the offer.
Random Model: This model assigns offers randomly, using predefined configurations for simplicity or testing.
Picker Model: This model selects the best products to include in product-based offers, ensuring the right items are recommended.

_--------------------------
Model Registration in MLFlow
"Once the models are trained, they need to be registered in MLFlow for version control and tracking."
Random Model Example: ngp_random_bspr_overlay
Uplift Model Example: ngp_uplift_bspr_overlay_champion
Control Model Example: ngp_control
Explain that MLFlow helps track different models, making it easier to manage multiple versions of models over time.
-------------------------------
Executing the Modeling Workflow
"The process of training and registering models is automated through the following steps:"
Create a feature branch in Git: This allows the team to work on the code separately before merging changes.
Run the Quickstart Script: This script prepares the environment for model training and registration.
Trigger the Main Modeling Workflow in ADF: Azure Data Factory (ADF) automates the orchestration of model training and registration processes.
Conclusion
"By following these steps, we ensure that models are effectively trained and managed, which allows us to personalize offers and improve customer experience."

### **Slide 9: Monarch Workflow Phase**  

### **Introduction**
Start by introducing the phase:
- **"In the Monarch Workflow phase, the trained models are applied to customers for offer deployment. This is where we ensure that personalized offers reach the right customers at the right time."**

### **Steps in the Monarch Workflow**

1. **Offer Routing:**
   - **"First, offers are routed to the appropriate customers based on their profiles and the model's recommendations."**
   - Explain that routing determines the right customers who should receive which offers.
   
2. **Model Application:**
   - **"After routing, the trained models are applied to these customers to generate the best offers for them."**
   - This is where the actual magic of personalization happens, ensuring customers get relevant offers.

3. **QA File Generation:**
   - **"Next, we generate a QA file, which acts as a record of the offers assigned to customers, for quality assurance."**
   - Emphasize that this ensures accuracy in the offer assignments and helps track any discrepancies.

4. **Offer Delivery:**
   - **"Finally, the offers are delivered to customers, completing the workflow."**
   - This step involves sending the actual offers through the chosen channels (email, app, etc.).

---

### **Notifications Section**

- **"Throughout the Monarch Workflow, notifications are sent at key stages to keep all stakeholders informed and ensure transparency."**
- Explain that notifications might include alerts for when the model is applied, when the QA file is generated, or when offers are successfully delivered.
