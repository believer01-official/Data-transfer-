Introduction
Start by introducing the slide with a brief overview:

"In this phase of the Next Gen Platform, we focus on training machine learning models that assign personalized offers to Starbucks customers. Let me take you through the details of the model training process."
Objective
"The primary goal of this phase is to train machine learning models that can assign relevant offers to customers based on their behavior and preferences."
This is the foundational objective, setting the stage for the audience.

Types of Offers
"We create two main types of offers for the customers."
Product-Based Offers: These are tailored based on product recommendations (e.g., a customer gets an offer on a product they are likely to purchase).
Frequency-Based Offers: These offers depend on how frequently a customer interacts with Starbucks (e.g., offers for customers who visit regularly).
Types of Models
"The platform employs three types of models for offer assignment."
Uplift Model: This model determines the best offers based on customer behavior and the expected effectiveness of the offer.
Random Model: This model assigns offers randomly, using predefined configurations for simplicity or testing.
Picker Model: This model selects the best products to include in product-based offers, ensuring the right items are recommended.
Model Registration in MLFlow
"Once the models are trained, they need to be registered in MLFlow for version control and tracking."
Random Model Example: ngp_random_bspr_overlay
Uplift Model Example: ngp_uplift_bspr_overlay_champion
Control Model Example: ngp_control
Explain that MLFlow helps track different models, making it easier to manage multiple versions of models over time.
Executing the Modeling Workflow
"The process of training and registering models is automated through the following steps:"
Create a feature branch in Git: This allows the team to work on the code separately before merging changes.
Run the Quickstart Script: This script prepares the environment for model training and registration.
Trigger the Main Modeling Workflow in ADF: Azure Data Factory (ADF) automates the orchestration of model training and registration processes.
Conclusion
"By following these steps, we ensure that models are effectively trained and managed, which allows us to personalize offers and improve customer experience."
Presentation Tips:
Be clear and concise: Explain each section in a simple manner to keep the audience engaged.
Use visuals: If you have any relevant diagrams, include them to visually explain concepts like the MLFlow registration or model types.
Relate to the audience: Emphasize how the models improve the Starbucks customer experience by providing personalized offers.
Practice: Rehearse explaining each section smoothly to ensure you stay within time and cover all important points.
