## **Steps to Implement Batch Bake and Store Segmentation**  

### **Batch Bake**  

#### **1. Assign SKUs to Stores**  
- **Objective**: Map SKUs to stores using bakery temperature data (frozen or ambient).  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Collect item "ranging" data from inventory management.  
  2. Assign SKUs based on bakery temperature.  
  3. Validate data for uniqueness, null values, and proper SKU assignments using **cuallee**.  
- **Outcome**: A table mapping SKUs to stores for future batch bake tasks.  

#### **2. Push Bake Schedule**  
- **Objective**: Deliver updated schedules to stores via SPC Azure storage.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Generate weekly schedules in JSON format with store metadata.  
  2. Publish schedules to Azure storage.  
  3. Log schedules in a sent-schedules table.  
- **Outcome**: Stores receive updated schedules, ensuring continuity in bakery operations.  

#### **3. Train, Forecast, and Allocate Bake Schedule**  
- **Objective**: Use historical sales data to forecast demand and allocate schedules.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Train models with half-hourly sales data for each store and notional product.  
  2. Forecast sales using **sktime-based** models.  
  3. Allocate bake schedules based on profitability and demand predictions.  
  4. Update existing schedule tables with new forecasts.  
- **Outcome**: Optimized schedules aligned with forecasted demand and profitability.
