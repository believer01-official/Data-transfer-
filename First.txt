The SQL query inserts aggregated data into the `tbl_WeeklyData` table by selecting and transforming records from the `tbl_FBD_Repack`, `tbl_DateRef`, and `tbl_DCBuildings_xwalk` tables. It targets columns such as `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `WEEK_ENDING`, `WHSE`, `BLDG`, `Parent`, `AREA`, `Dept`, `UOM`, `Actual`, `Plan`, `Fiscal Month`, and `FYWeekNo`. The `AREA` is set to 'InBound', the `Dept` to 'FBD PTL Bypass', and the `UOM` to 'CASES'. The query calculates `Actual` as the sum of `cases` from `tbl_FBD_Repack` and sets `Plan` to 0. It joins `tbl_FBD_Repack` with `tbl_DateRef` based on `DATES` and with `tbl_DCBuildings_xwalk` based on `BLDG`. The data is filtered to include dates less than the start of the current week. Grouping by various fields ensures accurate aggregation. This operation updates the weekly data with detailed information about FBD PTL Bypass operations, associating each building with its parent location and aligning dates with fiscal periods.
