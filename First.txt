The SQL query inserts data into the `tbl_WeeklyData` table by selecting specific records from `tbl_WeeklyData` and joining them with the `qry_Reserve_UPC` table. It targets records where the department (`DEPT`) is 'Pallet Pull' and the unit of measure (`UOM`) is 'Cases'. The query matches records between `tbl_WeeklyData` and `qry_Reserve_UPC` based on the building (`BLDG`), warehouse (`WHSE`), week ending date (`WEEK_ENDING`), and year (`Year`). It selects fields such as `Year`, `Month`, `FiscalMonth`, `FYWeekNo`, `WEEK_ENDING`, `WHSE`, `BLDG`, `Parent`, `AREA`, and `DEPT` from `tbl_WeeklyData`, and sets the unit of measure (`UOM`) to 'Units'. Additionally, it populates the `Actual` column with the `upc` value from `qry_Reserve_UPC`. This operation updates the weekly data by incorporating UPC information for the specified department and unit of measure.
