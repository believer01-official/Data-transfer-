# Dataserve, Digital Drive Thru (DDT), and Getrecs Documentation  

## **Dataserve**  

### **Introduction**  
Dataserve is a cloud-based tool for managing and analyzing data, functioning as an interface between users and servers. Its three core elements are **Onboarding**, **Loading**, and **Serving**, with the latter being the most widely used.  

Dataserve serves two applications:  
1. **Play_id**: Provides single predictions based on location number and operating date.  
2. **PlayBuilder_id**: Provides multiple predictions by combining store number, starting time, and ending time.  

**Tokens** such as the Bearer token authorize Dataserve URLs. A sample Dataserve URL:  
`https://aireserve-prod.azure-api.net/serve/dat/playbuilder/prod/play`  

Dataserve's production must be monitored every 4 hours.

### **Key APIs**  

#### **1. Onboarding API**  
- Defines the outline for loading data into the server.  
- Involves a manifest file in JSON format, with delta or parquet data types.  
- Identified by type (data/model), app name, and dataset name.  

**Response Codes**:  
- 200: Success  
- 400: Bad Request  
- 401: Unauthorized  

#### **2. Loading API**  
- Data is loaded by the ROA and AI Reserve teams into Cosmos DB.  
- Data bricks jobs are triggered.  

**Response Codes**:  
- 200: Success  
- 400: Invalid Request  
- 500: Internal Server Error  

#### **3. Serving API**  
- User-facing and fetches requested data from Cosmos DB.  
- Requires URL, Bearer token, filters, subscription key, and correlation ID.  

---

### **Dataserve Architecture**  
Data is onboarded via APIs, invoked by scoring pipelines, and served to users through query parameters (play_id and playbuilder_id).  

---

### **Monitoring**  
**Datadog Dashboard Metrics**:  
- **Response Codes**: Charts for 200, 400, and 500 codes.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time, single/multiple predictions, and regional response time.  
- **Kubernetes Monitoring**: CPU, memory, and pod details.  

---

## **Digital Drive Thru (DDT)**  

### **Introduction**  
DDT recommends products at drive-thru locations based on store, location, weather, time, and historical purchase data. It utilizes **AI/ML reinforcement learning** to make real-time predictions.  

**Key Features**:  
- **Zero Cart**: No items in the cart.  
- **Plus Cart**: Recommendations updated upon product addition.  

---

### **DDT Workflow**  
1. Customers send requests via a proxy and firewall to the open API.  
2. The request is authenticated via Azure Auth and directed to the orchestrator.  
3. The **Deep Brew Tardigrade algorithm** processes the request using:  
   - **DQN**: Selects product categories.  
   - **IMS**: Filters unavailable products.  

**Key Monitoring Metrics** (via Datadog):  
- Throughput distribution.  
- Application latency (P95, P99).  
- CPU and memory utilization.

## **Getrecs**  

### **Introduction**  
Getrecs provides **store-based recommendations**, considering product availability and seasonal trends. Recommendations adapt to cart updates, leveraging customer purchasing history and store inventory.  

---

### **Architecture**  
The frontend (AKS-EUS cluster) interfaces with the backend (Bandits) using the **Thompson Algorithm**, which ranks recommendations based on customer needs and purchase frequency.  

---

### **Pipelines**  
Getrecs operates via five pipelines, categorized into **data processing** and **data loading**:  

#### **1. Data Processing Pipelines**  
- **Store_Details**: Fetches and updates store data weekly (10 minutes).  
- **POS_Data**: Processes transactional data daily (22 minutes).  
- **Db_ETL**: Creates feature data for recommendations weekly (3 hours).  

#### **2. Data Loading Pipelines**  
- **Upload_to_Redis**: Uploads db_etl output (except user-product interaction) weekly (15 minutes).  
- **Data_Loading_and_Switching**: Loads user-product interaction data into SQL Server weekly (4 hours 50 minutes).  

---

### **Error Handling**  
If pipelines fail, alerts are triggered via Slack. Failed child pipelines are re-run for specific dates.  

---

### **Monitoring**  
Pipelines are monitored using **Azure Data Factory** and logs are stored in **App Insights**.

This structured documentation includes the introduction, workflow, monitoring metrics, pipelines, and error handling processes for Dataserve, DDT, and Getrecs, providing a comprehensive overview of these systems.
