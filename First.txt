**Slide 3: Objective**
- Provide a comprehensive overview of the Digital Drive-Thru (DDT) Application.
- Emphasize its functionality, architecture, and key operational processes.
- Highlight the use of advanced AI/ML-based algorithms for real-time product recommendations at drive-thru locations.
- Discuss essential monitoring aspects, including performance metrics and latency monitoring through DataDog dashboards, ensuring seamless operation and low latency for real-time customer interactions.

**Slide 4: Introduction to Digital Drive-Thru**
- The DDT application leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to provide personalized product recommendations to customers at various drive-thru locations.
- Recommendations are tailored based on factors such as:
  - Store location
  - Weather conditions
  - Time of day
  - Historical customer purchase data
- The system uses reinforcement learning algorithms to analyze past customer behavior and optimize outcomes.

**Slide 5: Zero Cart and Plus Cart**
- **Zero Cart:** When there are no items in the customer's cart.
- **Plus Cart:** When the customer adds products to their cart, the application dynamically refreshes recommendations based on the newly added products.

**Slide 6: DDT Sequence Diagram**
- As soon as a customer adds a product to the cart, a POST request is sent to our endpoint.
- Stores without open internet access route traffic through a proxy (Blue Coat), then through "Retail Network Firewalls" (hosted in data centers in Florida/Virginia) to access the open network.
- The request is then routed to the Open API, which provides interface-level edge protection against internet attacks. Authentication is handled by Azure Auth.
- Requests from whitelisted IPs are transferred to the orchestrator, leading to the Deep Brew orchestration.
- The orchestrator determines the appropriate endpoint, such as the Tardigrade endpoint.
- The Deep Brew Tardigrade DDT algorithm generates new recommendations based on the request.
- **Recommendation Request Time (Reco Request):** The total time between the customer's POST request to Starbucks and the response.

**Slide 7: DDT Workflow Diagram**
- Upon adding a product to the cart, a POST request reaches the Deep Brew orchestrator.
- The orchestrator detects the user request and directs it to the traffic manager.
- The traffic manager manages traffic by splitting it into two regions: East US and Central US. All requests are in the form of APIs, managed by Azure API Management.
- Azure API Management routes the request to Frontend Ingress and Backend Ingress.
  - **Frontend Ingress:** Performs authentication, preprocesses the request, and switches to Backend Ingress.
  - **Backend Ingress:** Based on the type of request and force variant, selects the backend model, provides model training, generates the model response, and returns it to the user.
- **Logging:** App Insights and New Relic are used for logging.

**Slide 8: Monitoring and Metrics**
- The DDT application employs the DataDog dashboard for monitoring purposes.
- Monitoring is conducted every 8 hours to ensure smooth system functioning.
- As a real-time application, low latency is a critical feature.

**Slide 9: Metrics Monitored**
- Throughput distribution
- P95 and P99 application latency
- P95 and P99 Redis latency
- Latency distribution graph
- Log counts distributions
- CPU usage by pod
- Memory usage by pod
- Pods running
- Worker timeouts (tracked from Azure Kubernetes Service)

**Slide 10: Key Features**
- AI/ML-driven recommendations for personalized customer experiences.
- Real-time updates with dynamic recommendation refreshes.
- Low latency for seamless performance.
- Advanced monitoring using DataDog dashboard and Azure Kubernetes Service.

**Slide 11: Conclusion**
- The Digital Drive-Thru (DDT) Application demonstrates the power of AI/ML algorithms in revolutionizing customer service through personalized recommendations.
- By utilizing real-time data and historical trends, the application enhances the drive-thru experience with optimized product suggestions.
- Detailed monitoring and performance tracking through DataDog dashboards ensure operational reliability, scalability, and efficiency.
- Continuous improvements and reinforcement learning make the DDT application a vital tool for delivering a superior customer experience, reinforcing its role in modern, data-driven retail environments.
