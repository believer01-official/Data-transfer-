### **Usuals in Azure Data Factory**  
"Usuals" refer to routine or common patterns in data processing, such as extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from various sources. In Azure Data Factory (ADF), these tasks include connecting to databases, applying transformations, and storing the processed data in data lakes or warehouses. They are automated using ADF pipelines to ensure efficiency and consistency.

### **Similarities in Azure Data Factory**  
"Similarities" in ADF typically relate to comparing datasets to identify patterns, matches, or duplicate records. For example, comparing sales data from different regions or detecting duplicate entries. ADF uses tools like mapping data flows or joins to process such comparisons efficiently, ensuring accurate and actionable insights.
