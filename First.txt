## **Model Training Phase**  

The **Model Training Phase** is a critical step in the NGP pipeline where data from the **Feature Phase** is utilized to train machine learning models. The models are designed to generate personalized Starbucks offers by analyzing customer data and behavior patterns.  

### **Key Objectives**  
- Leverage the prepared delta table data to train accurate machine learning models.  
- Identify patterns, preferences, and trends from historical and real-time data.  
- Develop models that predict the most relevant offers for individual customers.  

### **Steps Involved**  
1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Clean and preprocess the data from the delta table to ensure quality and consistency.  
   - Apply transformations to align the data with the model’s requirements.  

2. **Feature Selection**:  
   - Select the most relevant features (e.g., purchase history, demographics, preferences) for model training.  

3. **Model Selection**:  
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms based on the data and business objectives (e.g., recommendation systems, clustering, or classification models).  

4. **Training the Model**:  
   - Train the model using scalable PySpark-based workflows for handling large datasets.  
   - Ensure hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model’s performance.  

5. **Validation**:  
   - Validate the trained model using a test dataset.  
   - Measure performance metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy to ensure reliability.  

6. **Deployment Readiness**:  
   - Save the trained model and metadata into a **model registry** for version control and future deployment.  

### **Outputs**  
- Trained machine learning models ready for deployment in the Monarch Workflow phase.  
- Performance metrics and insights for monitoring and evaluation.

## **Monarch Workflow Phase**  

The **Monarch Workflow Phase** serves as the orchestration layer, coordinating the execution of all components in the pipeline, from feature extraction to the final delivery of personalized emails.  

### **Key Objectives**  
- Seamlessly integrate all phases of the NGP pipeline.  
- Ensure timely and accurate execution of feature ingestion, model training, and email delivery.  
- Monitor and handle dependencies, failures, and notifications.  

### **Steps Involved**  
1. **Workflow Orchestration**:  
   - Utilize **Airflow** to define and manage Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for the pipeline.  
   - Automate tasks such as feature ingestion, model training, anomaly detection, and email dispatch.  

2. **Dependency Management**:  
   - Monitor and ensure the completion of prerequisite tasks before starting dependent ones.  
   - Use **sensors** to verify database conditions and external pipeline completion.  

3. **Data Integration**:  
   - Fetch data from various sources and integrate it into a single workflow for consistent processing.  

4. **Execution of Models**:  
   - Load the trained models from the **model registry** and execute them on the current data.  
   - Generate predictions for personalized offers.  

5. **Anomaly Detection**:  
   - Run the **Expectations Module** to detect anomalies in the data or predictions.  
   - Generate and email a detailed HTML report for anomalies.  

6. **Email Dispatch**:  
   - Use the **Emailers Module** to send personalized offers to customers.  
   - Include anomaly insights if applicable.  

7. **Monitoring and Logging**:  
   - Monitor the execution of workflows through Airflow’s UI.  
   - Log all activities, including execution status, failures, and notifications, for audit and debugging.  

### **Outputs**  
- Personalized offer emails delivered to customers.  
- Consolidated logs and metrics for monitoring pipeline performance.

## **Additional Notes**  
- **Scalability**: The Monarch Workflow can scale to handle increasing data volumes and customer counts.  
- **Error Handling**: Includes automated retries, alerts, and notifications for failure scenarios.  
- **Real-time Insights**: Provides real-time execution status and logs for quick debugging and analysis.
