This SQL query inserts data into a table named `tbl_WeeklyData`. It selects values from another table `tbl_WeeklyData` and a query named `qry_Reserve_UPC`, joining them on specific conditions. The inserted data includes various fields such as Year, Month, Fiscal Month, etc., with 'Units' as the unit of measure (UOM). The query filters the data based on certain criteria, including the department being 'Cherry Pick' and the unit of measure being 'Cases'.ï¿¼Enter
ppcaseswk
This SQL query inserts data into the table `tbl_WeeklyData` by selecting specific columns from the joined tables `qry_PalletPullCases_Wk` and `tbl_DCBuildings_xwalk`. It retrieves data such as year, month, week ending, warehouse, building, parent, area, department, unit of measurement, actual values, fiscal month, and fiscal week number. The query joins the tables based on matching values in the `BLDG` column.
ptl ypass cases
This SQL query inserts data into the table `tbl_WeeklyData` by selecting specific columns from the tables `tbl_FBD_Repack`, `tbl_DateRef`, and `tbl_DCBuildings_xwalk`. It calculates the sum of cases as 'Actual' and sets 'Plan' to zero. The query filters the data based on the condition that the `DATES` column in `tbl_FBD_Repack` is less than the current date minus the number of days from the beginning of the current week. The data is grouped by year, month, week ending, warehouse, building, parent, area, department, unit of measurement, fiscal month, and fiscal week number.
bypass units
This SQL query inserts data into the table `tbl_WeeklyData` by selecting specific columns from the tables `tbl_FBD_Repack`, `tbl_DateRef`, and `tbl_DCBuildings_xwalk`. It calculates the sum of units as 'Actual' and sets 'Plan' to zero. The query filters the data based on the condition that the `DATES` column in `tbl_FBD_Repack` is less than the current date minus the number of days from the beginning of the current week. The data is grouped by year, month, week ending, warehouse, building, parent, area, department, unit of measurement, fiscal month, and fiscal week number.
shuttleacses
This SQL query inserts data into the table `tbl_WeeklyData` by selecting specific columns from the same table `tbl_WeeklyData`. It calculates the average of the 'Actual' column and sets the 'DEPT' column to 'Shuttle'. The data is filtered to include only rows where the `DEPT` column is either 'Pallet Pull' or 'Putaway' and the `UOM` column is 'Cases'. The data is then grouped by year, month, week ending, warehouse, building, parent, area, department, unit of measurement, fiscal month, and fiscal week number.
shuttle pallets
This SQL query inserts data into the table `tbl_WeeklyData` by selecting specific columns from the same table `tbl_WeeklyData`. It calculates the average of the 'Actual' column and sets the 'DEPT' column to 'Shuttle'. The data is filtered to include only rows where the `DEPT` column is either 'Pallet Pull' or 'Putaway' and the `UOM` column is 'Pallets'. The data is then grouped by year, month, week ending, warehouse, building, parent, area, department, unit of measurement, fiscal month, and fiscal week number.
shittle units
This SQL query inserts data into the table `tbl_WeeklyData` by selecting specific columns from the same table `tbl_WeeklyData`. It calculates the average of the 'Actual' column and sets the 'DEPT' column to 'Shuttle'. The data is filtered to include only rows where the `DEPT` column is either 'Pallet Pull' or 'Putaway' and the `UOM` column is 'Units'. The data is then grouped by year, month, week ending, warehouse, building, parent, area, department, unit of measurement, fiscal month, and fiscal week number.
weekly all measures 
This SQL query inserts data into the table `tbl_weeklydata` by selecting specific columns from various tables (`All_YOY_History`, `tbl_DCBuildings_xwalk`, `tbl_AvP_Depts`, `tbl_DateRef`). It calculates the sum of volume and plan volume as 'Actual' and 'Plan' respectively. The data is filtered based on the condition that the `DATES` column in `All_YOY_History` is less than the current date minus the number of days from the beginning of the current week. The data is then grouped by year, month, week ending, warehouse, building, parent, area, department, unit of measurement, fiscal month, and fiscal week number, with a further condition that the year is greater than 2017.
volbldg
This SQL query inserts data into the table `tbl_UPH Volume BLDG` by selecting specific columns from tables `tbl_WeeklyData` and `tbl_UPHMeasures`. It calculates the sum of the 'Actual' column from `tbl_WeeklyData` and groups the data by year, month, week ending, warehouse, building, parent, area, department alternate, Vantage reference, unit of measurement, fiscal month, and fiscal week number. The 'area' column is determined based on a condition: if the Vantage reference is 'Support', then 'Support' is used; otherwise, the area from `tbl_WeeklyData` is used. The data is joined based on matching values in the `UOM` and `DEPT` columns from both tables.
palletpullcases view
This SQL statement creates or replaces a view named "QRY PALLETPULLCASES WK" in the schema "SCANALYTICS". The view has columns "YEAR", "MONTH", "WEEK_ENDING", "WHSE", "BLDG", "AR", "DE", "UO", "PPCASES", "PLAN", "FISCALMONTH", "CPCASES", "PULLCASES", and "FYWEEKNO". 

The view selects data from the table "tbl_WeeklyData" and calculates values for some columns based on certain conditions. It calculates the sum of 'actual' values for different departments ('Pulling' and 'Cherry Pick') and subtracts them to get 'PPCases'. It also calculates 'CPCases' and 'PullCases' separately. The 'Ar', 'De', and 'Uo' columns are set to constant values ('Reserve', 'Pallet Pull', 'Cases' respectively). The 'PLAN' column is set to 0 as a constant value.

The data is filtered to include only rows where the `UOM` column is 'Cases', and then it is grouped by year, month, week ending, warehouse, building, fiscal month, and fiscal week number.
reserveupc view
This SQL statement creates or replaces a view named "QRY RESERVE UPC" in the schema "SCANALYTICS". The view has columns "YEAR", "MONTH", "FISCALMONTH", "FYWEEKNO", "WEEK_ENDING", "WHSE", "BLDG", "PARENT", "AREA", "DEPT", "UNITS", "CASES", and "UPC".

The view selects data from the table "tbl_WeeklyData" and calculates values for some columns based on certain conditions. It calculates the sum of 'actual' values for 'Units' and 'Cases' separately. It then calculates the UPC (Units per Case) by dividing the sum of 'Units' by the sum of 'Cases', but only if the sum of 'Cases' is not zero to avoid division by zero error.

The data is filtered to include only rows where the `UOM` column is either 'Units' or 'Cases', and then it is grouped by year, month, fiscal month, fiscal week number, week ending, warehouse, building, parent, area, and department. Finally, it applies a filter to include only rows where the area is 'Reserve' and the department is 'Pulling'.
