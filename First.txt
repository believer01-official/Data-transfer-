# **Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Document**  

## **1. Purpose**  
The purpose of this document is to analyze and identify the root cause of issues, implement resolutions, and ensure they do not recur. In case of similar future issues, this RCA will serve as a reference to quickly address the problem.  

---  

## **2. Description of the Issue**  
- **Issue Summary**: Provide a concise summary of the issue.  
- **Affected Region/Service**: Mention the geographical region or specific services impacted.  
- **Date and Time**: State the occurrence time of the issue.  

---

## **3. Observations**  
- Detail any symptoms observed, such as response time spikes, throughput dips, or pod restarts.  
- Highlight the impact on users or services.  

---

## **4. Analysis**  
### **Case 1: Response Time Spikes/Throughput Dips**  
Steps to investigate:  
1. **Region Check**: Verify the specific region affected.  
2. **Pod Status**:  
   - Check for restarts or scale-ups.  
   - If restarts occurred, identify the reasons.  
3. **Pod CPU and Memory Utilization**:  
   - Analyze metrics for abnormal patterns.  
4. **Pipeline Health**: Check pipelines for any errors or delays.  
5. **APIM Logs**: Inspect logs for traffic spikes or errors.  
6. **Traffic Analysis**: Evaluate traffic patterns during the spike time.  
7. **Datadog Logs and Traces**: Examine logs for bottlenecks or errors.  

### **Case 2: Pod Restarts**  
Steps to investigate:  
1. **Reason for Pod Restart**: Check events causing the restart (e.g., OOM errors).  
2. **Pod Resource Usage**: Analyze CPU and memory utilization.  
3. **Pod Logs**: Retrieve and review logs from AKS for error messages or anomalies.

## **5. Cause**  
- Provide a detailed explanation of the root cause based on observations and analysis.  
- Include any contributing factors that worsened the situation.  

---

## **6. Resolution**  
- Outline the steps taken to resolve the issue.  
- Mention any system configurations or resource adjustments applied.  

---

## **7. Preventive Measures**  
- Describe the actions implemented to prevent recurrence, such as:  
  - Enhancing monitoring systems.  
  - Increasing resource allocation thresholds.  
  - Setting up automated alerts for potential issues.  

---

## **8. Lessons Learned**  
- Share insights gained from the incident and its resolution.  
- Recommend best practices for similar scenarios in the future.  

---

## **Appendices**  
- Include any relevant screenshots, logs, or metrics graphs for reference.  
- Add links to related documentation or knowledge base articles.  

### **Conclusion**  
This document ensures a structured approach to identify and resolve issues effectively. It serves as a valuable reference for future troubleshooting efforts.
