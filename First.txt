Digital Drive-Thru (DDT) Application Documentation
Introduction
The Digital Drive-Thru (DDT) application is a cutting-edge system that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to provide personalized product recommendations to customers at various drive-thru locations. These recommendations are tailored based on factors such as the store, its location, weather conditions, time of the day, and historical customer purchase data. The system uses reinforcement learning algorithms to analyze past customer behavior and optimize outcomes.
Key Concepts
1. Zero Cart
When there are no items in the customer's cart, the state is referred to as a Zero Cart.
2. Plus Cart
When the customer adds products to their cart, it transitions to a Plus Cart. As items are added, the application dynamically refreshes recommendations based on the newly added products.
Monitoring and Metrics
The DDT application employs the DataDog dashboard for monitoring purposes. Monitoring is conducted every 8 hours to ensure the smooth functioning of the system. The application is real-time, and low latency is a critical feature.
Metrics Monitored
The following metrics are monitored on the DataDog dashboard:
- Throughput distribution.
- P95 and P99 application latency.
- Maximum CPU utilization.
- Maximum memory utilization.
- DDT front-end pod details.
- Worker timeouts (tracked from Azure Kubernetes Service).
Key Features
- AI/ML-driven recommendations for personalized customer experiences.
- Real-time updates with dynamic recommendation refreshes.
- Low latency for seamless performance.
- Advanced monitoring using DataDog dashboard and Azure Kubernetes Service.
