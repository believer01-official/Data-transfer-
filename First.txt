## **1. Introduction**  
The **Next Generation Platform (NGP)** is a scalable and efficient PySpark-based application, managed through **Airflow**, designed to deliver **personalized Starbucks offers** via email.  

NGP leverages advanced data processing, model training, and workflow management to extract, process, and utilize data from various sources to generate highly targeted recommendations for customers.  

### **Purpose**  
The primary objective of NGP is to streamline and automate the process of sending personalized offers, enhancing customer engagement and satisfaction.  

---

## **2. System Overview**  
- **Technology Stack**:  
  - PySpark  
  - Airflow  
  - Databricks  
  - Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)  
- **Goal**: To deliver personalized Starbucks offers to customers through email.  
- **Output**: Highly targeted and personalized email recommendations.  

---

## **3. Key Phases of NGP**  

### **Feature Phase**  
- Extract data from various sources (e.g., EDAP) and organize it into a **final delta table** for further processing.  

### **Model Training**  
- Use the delta table data to train machine learning models for creating personalized offers.  

### **Monarch Workflow**  
- Manage and coordinate all activities to ensure seamless transitions from data ingestion to personalized email delivery.  

---

## **4. Feature Phase: Detailed Description**  

### **Data Extraction and Arrangement**  
- Extract and process data from **EDAP** and other sources.  
- Arrange the data into a structured **delta table** for downstream usage.  
- Dynamically generate code during pipeline execution, saved in **ADLS** at two locations for redundancy.  

### **Feature Pipelines**  
- **Pipelines in Operation**:  
  - **10 pipelines** currently active in the pre-production environment.  
- **Key Activities**:  
  - **Concurrency Management**: Ensures efficient parallel execution.  
  - **Run ID and DS Value Tracking**: Logs execution metadata.  
  - **Interactive Clusters**: Supports real-time data processing.  
  - **NGP Run Status**: Monitors overall execution progress.  
  - **Generated Programs**: Dynamically created and stored programs.  

### **Sensors**  
Sensors ensure all conditions are met before ingestion:  
1. **Databricks Table Sensor**: Verifies database conditions.  
2. **External Sensors**: Ensures dependent pipelines are completed.  

### **Feature Ingestion**  
- Core data processing phase where data extraction and ejection occur.  
- **Key Classes**:  
  - **Sequel Operation Class**: Handles feature extraction tasks.  
  - **PySpark Operator Class**: Executes Spark-based operations.  
  - **PyScript Operator Class**: Facilitates custom script execution.

## **5. Expectations Module**  
The expectations module is responsible for:  
- Detecting anomalies in the data.  
- Producing a detailed **HTML report** of detected anomalies.  
- Emailing the report for review and corrective action.  

---

## **6. Emailers**  
- Configured with:  
  - Recipient email addresses.  
  - An email-level indicator (e.g., "detect") to control email dispatch.  
- Emails include detailed insights into anomalies or execution outcomes.  

---

## **7. Final Output**  
The NGP process concludes with the delivery of **personalized emails** to Starbucks customers, combining the results of robust data extraction, processing, and machine learning workflows.  

---

## **Conclusion**  
The Next Generation Platform (NGP) is a cutting-edge solution that integrates modern data engineering and machine learning techniques to deliver personalized customer experiences. By leveraging the NGP framework, Starbucks ensures timely and accurate delivery of offers, fostering enhanced customer engagement.
