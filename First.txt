To help you with high-quality documentation for **Dataserve as an API**, I can provide a structured and detailed document. Hereâ€™s how the outline will look:

### **Dataserve API Documentation**

#### **Introduction to Dataserve**

Dataserve is a **cloud-based tool** that is designed to manage and analyze data efficiently. It exposes data as an **API**, acting as an intermediary between the user and the server. With its ability to handle massive datasets and serve data through various endpoints, it simplifies the integration process for users who need real-time or historical data.

Dataserve functions with three core elements:

1. **Onboarding API**  
2. **Loading API**  
3. **Serving API**

These APIs facilitate different data operations, ranging from data onboarding, data transformation, to data retrieval.

---

#### **1. Dataserve as an API**

Dataserve exposes several endpoints that handle different operations. The system is designed to allow seamless data onboarding, data loading, and data serving for external applications. Below are the key components of the Dataserve API:

- **API Gateway**: The API is accessed via an API Gateway, ensuring security and scalability.
- **Token Authentication**: APIs are protected through bearer tokens for ensuring secure access.
- **Endpoint Structure**: Each API (Onboarding, Loading, and Serving) has its specific endpoint for targeted functionality.

#### **2. Onboarding API**

The **Onboarding API** facilitates the initial upload and verification of data into the Dataserve system. This process is **a one-time setup** for uploading a manifest file, which is critical for further processing. Here are the key components:

##### **Functionality:**
- **Manifest File**: The onboarding process involves using a manifest file, typically in **JSON format**, which contains metadata about the data to be loaded.
- **Data Types**: The file can contain data in **delta** (incremental) or **parquet** (structured) formats.
- **App and Dataset Identification**: The manifest file can be identified by the **data type** (data or model), **app name** (e.g., playbuilder), and **dataset name** (e.g., play or guidance).

##### **Error Scenarios:**
- **Invalid Manifest File**: If the manifest file structure does not meet the expected format or contains errors, the API returns an appropriate error code (e.g., `400 Bad Request`).
- **Missing Data**: In case the data mentioned in the manifest file is incomplete or cannot be accessed, a `404 Not Found` error might be returned.

**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Manifest file successfully validated."
}
```

---

#### **3. Loading API**

The **Loading API** enables the **ingestion** of data into the Dataserve platform. It is invoked after the onboarding process, when data is ready to be loaded into the underlying databases (e.g., Cosmos DB).

##### **Functionality:**
- **Data Loading**: The ROA (Read-Only Access) and AI Reserve teams typically trigger the **Loading API**. It initiates the transformation of data from the source to the destination databases.
- **Triggering Data Jobs**: When data is loaded, jobs such as **Data Bricks** transformations may be triggered to process and analyze the data.

##### **Error Scenarios:**
- **Data Load Failure**: If the data cannot be loaded due to network issues or system downtime, a `500 Internal Server Error` is returned.
- **Data Inconsistencies**: If the data fails validation checks, the API might return a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error.

**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Data loaded successfully.",
  "job_id": "12345"
}
```

#### **4. Serving API**

The **Serving API** is the primary interface used by consumers or applications to **fetch data** from the Dataserve platform. It is responsible for providing real-time or batch data queries as per the user's request.

##### **Functionality:**
- **Data Retrieval**: The **Serving API** fetches data from Cosmos DB based on queries such as `play_id` (for single prediction) or `playbuilder_id` (for multiple predictions).
- **Authentication**: Requests to the Serving API require a **bearer token** for authorization and **correlation ID** for tracking the request.
- **Filters and Query Parameters**: Consumers can filter the data based on parameters like `location_id`, `start_time`, and `end_time`.

##### **Error Scenarios:**
- **Unauthorized Access**: If a request is missing or contains an invalid token, the API returns a `401 Unauthorized` error.
- **No Data Found**: If no data is returned based on the query, a `404 Not Found` response is issued.

**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Data retrieved successfully.",
  "data": [
    {"location_id": "123", "date": "2022-01-01", "prediction": "value"}
  ]
}
```

#### **End-to-End Flow of Dataserve API**

The process flow from data onboarding to serving is as follows:

1. **Onboarding Process**: The manifest file is uploaded via the **Onboarding API**, validating the data.
2. **Data Loading**: Once onboarding is successful, the **Loading API** is triggered to store the data in Cosmos DB.
3. **Data Serving**: After the data is loaded, the **Serving API** allows consumers to retrieve the data using specific identifiers (`play_id`, `playbuilder_id`).

#### **Monitoring Dataserve**

Dataserve's performance and health are continuously monitored using various metrics and tools like **DataDog**.

##### **Metrics Monitored:**
- **Response Codes**: Metrics for HTTP response codes (e.g., `200`, `400`, `500`).
- **Usage Metrics**: Metrics like **avg. response time**, **prediction counts**, **percentile response times**, and **region-wise usage**.
- **Kubernetes Metrics**: Monitoring CPU and memory usage by pods, and the number of pods running.

#### **Conclusion**

Dataserve provides an efficient, scalable, and secure API-based platform for managing large datasets. With three key APIs (Onboarding, Loading, and Serving), it ensures that users can easily onboard data, load it into the system, and retrieve it based on real-time requirements. With integrated monitoring and error handling, it ensures smooth operation across various stages of the data lifecycle.
