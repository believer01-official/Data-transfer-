## **Batch Bake Overview**  
Batch Bake processes optimize bakery operations by managing schedules, inventory, and forecasting demand. These pipelines ensure efficient workflows, SKU assignments, and timely data updates.  

---

## **Pipelines in Batch Bake**  

### **1. Assign SKUs to Stores**  
- **Purpose:** Updates SKU-to-store mappings based on bakery temperatures (frozen/ambient).  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Collect item "ranging" data from inventory management.  
  2. Assign SKUs based on bakery temperature.  
  3. Validate data using cuallee.  
- **Outcome:** A table mapping SKUs to stores for future batch bake tasks.  
- **Support Details:**  
  - **Platform:** Databricks  
  - **Frequency:** Weekly  
  - **SLA:** 20 minutes  
- **Failure Points:** Data validation errors, transitioning supply chains.  

---

### **2. Push Bake Schedule**  
- **Purpose:** Publishes bake schedules to store iPads and updates receipts for tracking.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Generate weekly schedules in JSON format with store metadata.  
  2. Publish schedules to Azure storage.  
  3. Log schedules in a sent schedules table.  
- **Outcome:** Stores receive updated schedules, ensuring bakery continuity.  
- **Support Details:**  
  - **Platform:** Databricks  
  - **Frequency:** Weekly  
  - **SLA:** 20 minutes  
- **Failure Points:** Ensuring previous schedules remain available.  

---

### **3. Train, Forecast, and Allocate Bake Schedule**  
- **Purpose:** Trains models, forecasts demand, and allocates schedules.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Train models with half-hourly sales data.  
  2. Forecast sales using sktime models.  
  3. Allocate bake schedules based on profitability and demand.  
  4. Update existing schedule tables with new forecasts.  
- **Outcome:** Optimized schedules based on demand and profitability.  
- **Support Details:**  
  - **Platform:** Databricks  
  - **Frequency:** Weekly  
  - **SLA:** 1 hour  
- **Failure Points:** Insufficient historical data, oversized data partitions.

## **Store Segmentation Overview**  
Store segmentation moves away from a "one-size-fits-all" approach by offering tailored groupings based on product mix, daypart demand, and store type. It enables better decision-making and targeted business strategies.  

---

## **Segmentation Models**  

### **1. Channel and Daypart Segmentation**  
- **Purpose:** Differentiates cafe and drive-thru store performance.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Perform K-Means clustering on scaled data.  
  2. Use heatmaps and spider plots to visualize cluster performance.  
  3. Assign clusters based on key metrics (demand, performance).  
- **Outcome:** 5 clusters for drive-thru stores, 4 for cafes (excluding pickup locations).  

### **2. Product Mix Segmentation**  
- **Purpose:** Groups stores by beverage and food offerings.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Build models for “beverage only” and “beverage & food” segments.  
  2. Perform clustering and visualize results.  
  3. Segment based on product types (espresso, frappuccino, tea, snacks).  
- **Outcome:** 4 clusters for beverage-only stores, 7 for beverage & food stores.  

### **3. Customer Segmentation**  
- **Purpose:** Profiles customer behavior before and after COVID.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Use metrics like regular revenue %, commuter %, and tourist transactions %.  
  2. Compare demographic data to identify behavioral changes.  
  3. Segment stores accordingly for targeted marketing.  
- **Outcome:** Segments based on customer behavior and demographics for improved strategies.  

---

## **Store Segmentation Pipeline**  
- **Pipeline Name:** `store_segmentation_beverage_pipeline`  
- **Purpose:** Categorizes stores into clusters for quick analysis based on demand and product mix.  
- **Workflow:**  
  1. Collect sales, time, and product data.  
  2. Create feature tables for clustering models.  
  3. Train and validate models.  
- **Support Details:**  
  - **Platform:** ADF & Databricks  
  - **Frequency:** Monthly (3rd day)  
  - **SLA:** 45 minutes

## **Pipeline Overview**  

### **Batch Bake Pipelines**  

| Pipeline               | Purpose                                | Frequency | Platform  | SLA  |  
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------|  
| Assign SKUs to Stores  | Maps SKUs to stores using bakery data | Weekly    | Databricks | 20 min |  
| Push Bake Schedule     | Sends updated schedules to stores    | Weekly    | Databricks | 20 min |  
| Train, Forecast, Allocate | Trains models and forecasts schedules | Weekly    | Databricks | 1 hour |  

### **Store Segmentation Pipeline**  

| Pipeline                 | Purpose                            | Frequency | Platform      | SLA  |  
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|------|  
| Store Segmentation Pipeline | Segments stores by demand and product mix | Monthly    | ADF & Databricks | 45 min |

## **Conclusion**  
- **Batch Bake** ensures timely forecasting, schedule management, and SKU assignments.  
- **Store Segmentation** enables data-driven decisions by clustering stores based on demand, customer behavior, and product mix.  
- By leveraging advanced pipelines and machine learning models, these processes **drive efficiency, improve customer experiences, and support targeted strategies**.
