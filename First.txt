The SQL query inserts data into the `tbl_WeeklyData` table by selecting specific records from `tbl_WeeklyData` and joining them with the `qry_Reserve_UPC` table. It targets records where the department (`DEPT`) is 'Pallet Pull' and the unit of measure (`UOM`) is 'Cases'. The query matches records between `tbl_WeeklyData` and `qry_Reserve_UPC` based on the building (`BLDG`), warehouse (`WHSE`), week ending date (`WEEK_ENDING`), and year (`Year`). It selects fields such as `Year`, `Month`, `FiscalMonth`, `FYWeekNo`, `WEEK_ENDING`, `WHSE`, `BLDG`, `Parent`, `AREA`, and `DEPT` from `tbl_WeeklyData`, and sets the unit of measure (`UOM`) to 'Units'. Additionally, it populates the `Actual` column with the `upc` value from `qry_Reserve_UPC`. This operation updates the weekly data by incorporating UPC information for the specified department and unit of measure.
The SQL query inserts data into the `tbl_WeeklyData` table by selecting specific fields from the `qry_PalletPullCases_Wk` query and joining them with the `tbl_DCBuildings_xwalk` table. It targets columns such as `Year`, `Month`, `WEEK_ENDING`, `WHSE`, `BLDG`, `AREA`, `DEPT`, `UOM`, `Actual`, `Fiscal Month`, and `FYWeekNo` from `qry_PalletPullCases_Wk`, while also retrieving the `Parent` column from `tbl_DCBuildings_xwalk` based on a matching building (`BLDG`). This operation enhances the weekly data by incorporating detailed pallet pull case information and associating each building with its parent location, effectively updating the `tbl_WeeklyData` table with enriched and joined data from the specified query and table.
