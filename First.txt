**YMAL (You May Also Like) Application for Starbucks**

---

### **1. Introduction**

The YMAL (You May Also Like) application is designed to provide personalized alternative product recommendations to Starbucks customers. This system serves as a "challenger" model to the existing getrecs recommender system. Both systems display recommendations under the section titled "You May Also Like" in the Starbucks app. The goal of YMAL is to create a set of alternative product suggestions based on customer preferences, transaction history, and other contextual data, offering Starbucks customers an enhanced and personalized experience.
