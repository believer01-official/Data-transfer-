### **Slide 7: Serving API**
- **Slide Title:** Serving API
- **Key Points:**
  - **Purpose:** Fetch data using queries like `play_id` or `playbuilder_id`.
  - **Authentication:** Requires bearer token and correlation ID.
  - **Common Errors:**
    - Unauthorized access (401).
    - No data found (404).
  - **Sample Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "message": "Data retrieved successfully.",
      "data": [
        {"location_id": "123", "date": "2022-01-01", "prediction": "value"}
      ]
    }
    ```

---

### **Slide 8: End-to-End Flow**
- **Slide Title:** End-to-End Flow of Dataserve
- **Content:**
  - Step 1: Onboarding - Validate manifest file.
  - Step 2: Loading - Store data in Cosmos DB.
  - Step 3: Serving - Retrieve data using specific queries.
- Add a visual diagram to represent the flow.

---
