### **Batch Bake & Store Segmentation – Business Impact & Detailed Explanation** 

---

## **Batch Bake Overview – Why It Matters**  

Batch Bake is **essential for Starbucks’ bakery operations** because it ensures the **right bakery products are available at the right time** while minimizing waste and optimizing production. The process manages SKU assignments, baking schedules, and demand forecasting using data-driven insights. Without an optimized Batch Bake process, stores could face **stock shortages, excess waste, or inefficient baking schedules**, all of which negatively impact business operations and customer experience.  

---

## **Pipelines in Batch Bake – Real Business Impact**  

### **1. Assign SKUs to Stores – Ensuring the Right Products at the Right Stores**  

- **Why This Matters:**  
  Starbucks stores don’t all sell the same bakery products—some specialize in frozen items, others in ambient ones. If SKU assignments are incorrect, stores might receive products they **can’t store or prepare**, leading to **waste, lost sales, and customer dissatisfaction**.  

- **How It Works:**  
  - The pipeline collects **inventory data** to determine which stores should receive which SKUs.  
  - It assigns SKUs based on **bakery temperature (frozen vs. ambient)** to ensure compatibility.  
  - It validates data using **Cuallee** to catch errors like duplicates or missing values.  
Cuallee** is an **open-source data validation library for PySpark**, designed to ensure high-quality data processing in large-scale workflows. It provides **fast, efficient, and scalable data validation** by leveraging PySpark's distributed computing capabilities. 
  - The finalized **SKU-to-store mapping** is stored for downstream processes.  

- **Business Impact:**  
  - Prevents **inventory mismatches**, ensuring stores only receive the SKUs they can sell.  
  - Reduces **operational inefficiencies** by ensuring accurate stock assignments.  
  - Improves **customer satisfaction**—if a customer expects a bakery item, it should be available.

### **2. Push Bake Schedule – Ensuring Smooth Store Operations**  

- **Why This Matters:**  
  Bakery schedules are crucial for ensuring **freshly baked products** are available when customers want them. Without a **reliable schedule-pushing system**, stores might **bake at the wrong times**, leading to **stale products, waste, or lost sales**.  

- **How It Works:**  
  - The pipeline generates a **weekly baking schedule** in JSON format, including store metadata.  
  - It publishes the schedule to **Azure Storage**, so stores can access it via their iPads.  
  - It logs sent schedules to track **which stores received updates**.  

- **Business Impact:**  
  - Ensures **consistency in product availability**, reducing complaints about missing items.  
  - Prevents **operational confusion**, ensuring baristas and bakers know exactly when to prepare each item.  
  - Provides **historical tracking of schedules**, so Starbucks can analyze past baking patterns.  

---

### **3. Train, Forecast, and Allocate Bake Schedule – Predicting Demand & Reducing Waste**  

- **Why This Matters:**  
  Starbucks **can’t afford to overproduce or underproduce bakery items**. Overproduction leads to **waste and losses**, while underproduction results in **lost sales and disappointed customers**. Forecasting demand ensures that **each store receives an optimal baking schedule based on real demand**.  

- **How It Works:**  
  - Uses **historical sales data** to train a forecasting model.  
  - Applies **Sktime-based models** to predict demand for each store and product.  
  - Allocates bake schedules based on **profitability and predicted sales**.  
  - Updates existing schedule tables with the latest forecasts.  

- **Business Impact:**  
  - Reduces **food waste**, directly improving profitability and sustainability.  
  - Optimizes **inventory and staffing**, ensuring stores prepare the right quantity of items.  
  - Helps Starbucks **adjust to seasonal demand changes**, ensuring supply meets real customer needs.

## **Store Segmentation – Why It Matters**  

Starbucks doesn’t use a **one-size-fits-all** approach for its stores. Some stores cater to **commuters**, others to **tourists**, and others to **drive-thru customers**. If Starbucks treated all stores the same, it would **miss out on opportunities to tailor its product offerings, pricing, and marketing strategies**.  

**Store Segmentation enables Starbucks to group stores based on customer behavior, product sales, and location type, allowing for smarter business decisions.**  

---

## **Segmentation Models – Real Business Impact**  

### **1. Channel & Daypart Segmentation – Understanding Store Traffic Patterns**  

- **Why This Matters:**  
  A drive-thru store has very different traffic patterns compared to a cafe inside a shopping mall. If Starbucks doesn’t segment these stores properly, it might **staff them incorrectly or stock the wrong products**, leading to **inefficiencies and lost sales**.  

- **How It Works:**  
  - Uses **K-Means clustering** to analyze sales data and categorize stores.  
  - Visualizes results using **heatmaps and spider plots** to understand peak traffic times.  
  - Assigns stores into **clusters based on customer demand and sales trends**.  

- **Business Impact:**  
  - Allows for **better staffing decisions**, ensuring the right number of employees during peak hours.  
  - Helps Starbucks **optimize promotions**, targeting cafes and drive-thrus differently.  
  - Prevents **overstocking or understocking**, ensuring each store has the right products for its unique customer base.

### **2. Product Mix Segmentation – Customizing Store Offerings**  

- **Why This Matters:**  
  Not all Starbucks locations sell the same products. Some stores **focus more on beverages**, while others have a **strong demand for food items**. If Starbucks doesn’t account for this, stores might **waste space stocking items that don’t sell** while **missing out on high-demand products**.  

- **How It Works:**  
  - Builds models to separate **beverage-only stores from beverage-and-food stores**.  
  - Uses clustering and **heatmap visualizations** to understand product demand.  
  - Segments stores into **four beverage-only clusters and seven beverage-and-food clusters**.  

- **Business Impact:**  
  - Ensures **each store stocks products that match its customer preferences**.  
  - Reduces **inventory waste** by avoiding products that won’t sell well.  
  - Helps Starbucks **launch targeted promotions**, offering food discounts in high-food-demand stores.

### **3. Customer Segmentation – Adapting to Changing Consumer Behavior**  

- **Why This Matters:**  
  The way customers shop changed after **COVID-19**. Many commuters stopped visiting stores, while more tourists started buying at specific locations. If Starbucks didn’t analyze these changes, it would **continue stocking and staffing stores based on outdated trends**, leading to **revenue losses**.  

- **How It Works:**  
  - Uses **customer data** to analyze spending habits before and after COVID-19.  
  - Segments customers based on **regular revenue %, commuter %, and tourist transactions**.  
  - Compares demographic trends to understand how store traffic has changed.  

- **Business Impact:**  
  - Helps Starbucks **adjust pricing and promotions** based on new customer patterns.  
  - Allows stores to **adapt to shifting customer preferences**, ensuring they sell the right products.  
  - Improves **marketing effectiveness**, allowing Starbucks to target each segment with personalized offers.
